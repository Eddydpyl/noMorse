Doesn't it bother you when someone starts sending text messages, one after another, making your phone ring or vibrate like it's gone mad? I keep my App notifications on because I do want to be notified when someone writes to me. What I don't particularly enjoy is being informed of every single word they decide to type and immediately send, it's as if they were trying to talk to me in Morse code! I don't really have anything against bit-sized text messages, but this behavior many (if not all) messaging Apps have really gets on my nerves.

This open-source project aims to fix the problem by instructing its users on how to turn off sound and vibration for their favorite messaging Apps, so that we can handle that side of the notification and put an end to Morse code!
